# Video-transcript-generator

## Description

Since last year, as the COVID hit, we have been forced into isolating in our home and had to cope with
maintaining all of our business from home primarily. It has been trying times, but the lectures and academic workload is still there. On numerous occasions the students had to deal with missing lectures due to unavoidable circumstances. To deal with that student had to revisit the lectures. Same for preparing for the exams, the student had to revisit the lectures. And forced into our homes, many students dont have the perfect condition to listen to the lecture and take adequate notes. And the process of revisiting the lecture is very time consuming.

Therefore, I decided to design a program that would be fairly easy to use, and provide the student a transcript of the video file they input. So, they can read the text file, which will contain the transcription of the video. That will allow the students to skim through the material and take better notes. At the same time save valuable time in the process.

## How To setup and run the program:

In general, the user would require the following

* Stable internet connection
* Python 3
* FFMPEG
* IBM packages

Before you run the program check your network connection. The program may run slow if the network connection is unstable. The program may not work if the connection is lost on the user end.

### Python 3

Go to the following page to check if you have the python3 and if not how to download it.
